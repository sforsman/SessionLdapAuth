SessionLdapAuth
===============

This is just an internal module I did to be used for some of the company's projects requiring LDAP
login support. It supports the following features:

* Group mapper (example: "ADGroup1=pwgrp1,pwgrp2;ADGroup2=pwgrp3")
* Saving user's email
* Active Directory -support
* Defining the base DN
* TLS

Feel free to use any portion you like, in any way you like. I'm taking no responsibility however.

Good luck :)
